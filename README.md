# tkinter-calculators
Basic GUI calculators built using Python's Tkinter library. One provides separate buttons for each operation, while the other offers a more standard calculator interface.


This repository contains two simple graphical user interface (GUI) calculators created using Python's Tkinter library.

## Calculator 1: `gui CAlculator normal`

This calculator provides separate buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), and division (/). It also includes a button to display the results of all four operations at once.

### How to Use:

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the code as `gui_cal_normal.py` (or any other `.py` extension).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python gui_cal_normal.py
    ```

4.  Enter the first number in the "value 1" field and the second number in the "value 2" field.
5.  Click on the desired operator button (+, -, x, /) to see the result of that specific operation.
6.  Click on the "All operators" button to see the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division displayed together.

## Calculator 2: `gui calculator`

This calculator offers a more standard calculator interface with number buttons (0-9), basic arithmetic operators (+, -, x, /), a clear (C) button, a delete (Del) button, an equals (=) button, and a modulo (%) button.

### How to Use:

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the code as `gui_cal.py` (or any other `.py` extension).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python gui_cal.py
    ```

4.  Click on the number buttons and operator buttons to build your mathematical expression in the input field.
5.  Click the "=" button to calculate and display the result.
6.  Click the "C" button to clear the input field.
7.  Click the "Del" button to delete the last entered character.
8.  Click the "%" button to perform the modulo operation.

## Dependencies

Both calculators are built using the built-in Tkinter library in Python, so no additional installations are required.
